  [PACKAGING]

  - Debian libvigor-dev package should depend on upstream *-dev
    packages for header files like zmq.h


1.2.4        2015-03-01
(1:0:0)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - New pdu_dup() function for duplicating a PDU

  - New pdu_copy() function for copying sections of a PDU

  - Better shutdown signalling for the HA implementation
    Now, instead of pthread_cancel(), ha_shutdown() locks an exit
    mutex that signals to the HA thread that it needs to terminate
    gracefully.  This should make HA-based reactors more amenable
    to testing and instrumentation.

  - New vzmq_connect() function, that ties vzmq_resolve() together
    with plain old zmq_connect(), as a drop-in replacement.
    If you need to control which address families (IPv4 / IPv6) are
    considered for resolution, vzmq_connect_af() is provided.


  [BUG FIXES]

  - Fix overflow in HA time handling.  The HA thread will now no
    longer send packets at mind-boggling high rates.



1.2.3        2015-02-24
(1:0:0)

  [BUG FIXES]
  - Fix argument order in SHA1 functions, to correspond with
    conventions used elsewhere in libvigor.  Namely, sha1_*() should
    take the sha1_t as the first argument, not the last.



1.2.2        2015-02-22
(1:0:0)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  - New vzmq_resolve(char *endpoint, int af) function, for DNS
    resolution of 0MQ/TCP endpoints.

  - SHA1 implementation, lifted from Clockwork.



1.2.1        2015-02-11
(1:0:0)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  - Hash-based PDU serialization / de-serialization
    pdu_t + hash_t = awesomeness for extensible protocols!

  - Heartbeat implementation
    hb_t structure and hb_*() functions can be used to implement
    time-based delays with a backoff algorithm.

  - New tests for run2() UID / GID handling
    Ensure that we are honoring the UID / GID specifications
    given in runner_t.  Must run the tests as root to test.



1.2.0        2015-02-06
(1:0:0)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  - New ha_* implementation
    Implements the Binary Star HA pattern, from the ZeroMQ
    project.  Replaces the existing bstar_* functions / typedefs.



1.1.3        2015-01-27
(0:0:0)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  - New cache_isempty()  / cache_isfull() interface for querying
    if a cache is empty or full (respectively)

  - The 'len' parameter of cache_t was not used, and has been removed
    (replaced with a dummy member that will be ignored)

  [BUG FIXES]
  - Strip out comments when parsing configurations
    (pseudo-regression introduced in 1.1.2)



1.1.2        2015-01-26
(0:0:0)

  [BUG FIXES]

  - Support multi-token config values, for lines like:
    "sys.command    /bin/path/to/command --options"



1.1.1        2015-01-12
(0:0:0)
